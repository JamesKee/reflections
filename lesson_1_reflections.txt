diff or FC is a simple way to point out differences in two files!
this is great for debugging!

Easily accessing the history of a file makes it easier to quickly review changes
that have been made.  This is also really handy for debugging.

Autosave is obviously a great feature for things like office suites, but for code editors
it is better to have more control over when a project gets saved.  This ensures that a version of
the project isn't saved halfway through, which could potentially be buggy or broken.

git log - shows the commits
git diff - shows the differences between two commits
git checkout - returns to a previous commit

checkout is obviously great for making sure you don't break anything while changing code

git init - initializes the repository, which sets up git in the directory,
but doesn't add any commits or chose which files will be tracked.

the three parts of git are: 
1. the working directory
2. the stage
3. the repository

the stage is an intermediate area to give a buffer between the working directory and
the repository.  Files can be individually added to the stage and them committed to 
keep commits from getting to large.
